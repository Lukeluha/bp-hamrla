# Bachelor thesis by Lukas Hamrla - Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague, 2015

The topic of my bachelor thesis was **Web portal for high-school instruction support** and this repository is implementation part of my thesis.

The objective of the thesis was to attract and dulcify teaching for students and teachers so that students are going to more participate and show more activity. Application simplifies communication between students and teacher as well. There is quick use of application emphasised and on student anonymity for questions asking too. Due to accessibility, PHP is used as a programming language and MySQL as a database engine.

*Used technologies*: Nette Framework, MySQL, AngularJS, SASS

## Install
For install, just download source codes, then go to your webserver and visit URL `http://yourwebserver/www/install`. Then just fill database connection info and after that you should have installed this application.

In future, I'd like to add option for installing by composer.
